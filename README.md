# Maui.VectorIcons





## What works

All icons for these fonts:

- [x] AntDesign
- [x] Entypo
- [x] EvilIcons
- [x] Feather
- [x] FontAwesome
- [x] FontAwesome5 Free Regular & Solid
- [x] Fontisto
- [x] Foundation
- [x] Ionicons
- [x] MaterialIcons ( except `Goat` icon, see reason below)
- [x] Octicons
- [x] SimpleLineIcons
- [x] Zocial

## What doesn't work

Any font codes that has unicode value greater than 2 bytes

(x)  MaterialCommunityIcons  (99% of the icons have font codes value greater than 2 bytes)

(x)  FontAwesome5 Brand. (WIP) due to Glyph json file for FontAwesome5 combine all 3 regular solid & brand, this is fixable by create a seperate Glyph json file for FontAwesome 5 brand.
